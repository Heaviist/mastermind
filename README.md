The Odin Project´s Mastermind project in ruby

# Assignment
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.

# Goal
- Build the basic game where the computer generates a random code to be cracked by the human player.
- Add creator/guesser option for human player.
- Create code so the computer will try to guess when a human player chooses the code.
- Either create new rules or follow the rules of the game. In any case, try to implement a good strategy for the computer when playing the game.

# Expectations and challenges
- After the tic-tac-toe game this seems a bit like more of the same, but I'm sure there are some challenges I'm not seeing just yet.
- Probably gonna create a player class which then can be used in making a human player or computer player class.
- Have to research how to get random samples from the array of available colours. Class game might be used for this.
- Probably make the rules clear from the start.
- Think of a smart way to do input that make sense and convert that to something useful for the code so it can be compared.
- Somehow use a tracker during evaluation for keeping the number of correct colours and locations
- Human input for becoming a creator seems trivial.
- Creating the computer strategy might require a lot of conditionals and branching. Gonna be challenging to find out the best strategy and then convert that to working code that doesn't become a giant mess.
